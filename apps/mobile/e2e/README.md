# Native walkthrough helpers

The canonical scenario, ownership, evidence and publication procedure is in `docs/engineering/devops/shipping.md`.
Run the native accessibility helper regression tests from the repository root with `node --test apps/mobile/e2e/helpers/native-ax.test.mjs` when changing these helpers.

Mobile MCP text dumps include state names in their legend.
Use `isNativeFocused(dump, testID)` on a fresh observation before typing and `assertNativeValue(dump, testID, expected)` afterward.
These helpers inspect the exact element row and fail closed for missing or duplicate selectors.
They do not prove search results; assert the returned dish or empty-state recovery separately and retain the complete raw tool trace.
