# Native walkthrough helpers

The canonical scenario, ownership, evidence and publication procedure is in `docs/engineering/devops/shipping.md`.
Run the native accessibility helper regression tests from the repository root with `node --test apps/mobile/e2e/helpers/native-ax.test.mjs` when changing these helpers.

Mobile MCP text dumps include state names in their legend.
Use `isNativeFocused(dump, testID)` on a fresh observation before typing and `assertNativeValue(dump, testID, expected)` afterward.
These helpers inspect the exact element row and fail closed for missing or duplicate selectors.
They do not prove search results; assert the returned dish or empty-state recovery separately and retain the complete raw tool trace.

## Mixed-duration trial reminders

`paywall-mixed-trials-visual` covers annual two-day plus monthly seven-day trials and the reverse through the real three-screen onboarding journey.
Its shared helper checks the named reminder offer, the schedulable purchase default, live prices and renewal copy, plan switching, unavailable reminders for short trials with and without simulated opt-in, and the visual-only checkout guard.
Run it with `paywall-eligible-visual` through `scripts/sim/product-flow.mjs run <UDID> ... --mode=development` on an owned development build.
The `annual-short` and `monthly-short` visual parameters propagate unchanged between screens.
Every screenshot is labeled synthetic, and these flows request no notification permission, schedule nothing and cannot purchase or restore.
They do not establish eligible Apple or RevenueCat catalog acceptance.
When an actual eligible mixed catalog is available, separately verify both default purchases, plan switches, permission outcomes and the store-confirmed reminder schedule using that catalog and an eligible account.

## Preview Search highlight

`onboarding-search-highlight` follows real onboarding with meal prep selected so Search is the first preview tip.
It captures entry, settled pizza results and Back to Search, then verifies all five tips, completion, replay and Skip.
Run it on both a small and normal supported iPhone through the canonical simulator runner.
The entry screenshot records the first observed state; a fast response can finish before that capture, so it alone does not prove the loading transition.
Retain source-bound loading, transition and results captures with viewport and safe-area provenance when reproducing layout timing, and inspect equal clearance around the Search field and the tooltip position in each image.
Preserve original screenshots, approvals and raw failed evidence; obtain explicit UI approval for changed candidate states before final acceptance.

## Subscription Restore acceptance

`subscription-restore-expired` starts with an authenticated recreated Fitsy account on the ordinary paywall and an expired real Apple purchase belonging to the device's store account.
Prepare the purchase, expiry, account deletion and recreation through the actual product before running the flow.
Use the same Sign in with Apple identity, including its private-relay address when applicable.
The flow retains receipt and login state, restores through the visible control, checks Welcome back, and repeats the routing check after cold launch.
`subscription-restore-empty` is the negative control for a signed-in never-subscribed account whose store account has no Fitsy receipt.
`subscription-expired-routing` starts with an already expired subscription linked to the current Fitsy account and covers inactive Restore from Welcome back plus cold launch.
That same-account journey can use RevenueCat Test Store without requiring history transfer.
All flows require their documented starting state and fail if that state is absent.
Run simulator automation through the canonical procedure in the shipping contract; none of these flows resets billing state or fabricates receipts.
Use the same assertions as TestFlight walkthrough checkpoints when device automation is unavailable.

Capture the signed-in `/api/subscriptions/sync` verdict and freshness after Restore alongside the screen, binding them to the authenticated Fitsy user ID and candidate source without recording tokens.
Expired acceptance requires `synced: true`, `verdict: expired`, `active: false`, `stale: false`, and a recent `lastRcVerifiedAt`.
Also retain an active Restore or rebuy returning to its selected destination, foreground expiry, delayed synchronization and retry, and account-switch controls in the walkthrough.
RevenueCat Test Store cannot transfer history between app user IDs, so an empty Test Store Restore after recreation does not prove Apple receipt acceptance.
Use the compatible Apple TestFlight build and candidate OTA for that remaining store journey, and preserve its observed evidence separately from synthetic component tests.
